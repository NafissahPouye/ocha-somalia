                    <h1>Situation Overview (as of May 2017):</h1>
                    <p>An elevated risk of famine persists in some parts of Somalia due to severe food consumption gaps, high acute malnutrition and high disease burden. The Gu rains started later than normal and have so far been below average in all areas, except in the northeast where rains have been near average, according to FAO-SWALIM.  While rainfall in late April and in May has led to seed germination, reduced yields are expected due to early season losses and erratic rainfall.  A massive scale up of humanitarian response is ongoing, reaching more than 3 million people per month with life-saving assistance, livelihood support and protection services. However, funding gaps remain to sustain the operation. In May, Food Security partners reached 2.7 million of their 3.3 million people monthly target with improved access to food. While AWD/cholera cases continue to be reported, the situation is increasingly under control and the Case Fatality Rate is being reduced. While donor contributions continue to enable humanitarian partners to scale up life-saving and life sustaining humanitarian activities, sectors such as WASH have reduced their reach in May due to lack of resources. Further resources are urgently required to sustain the response into the second half of the year to avert loss of lives.</p>
